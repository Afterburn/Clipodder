Move along, nothing to see here. 



Dependencies:
	-- g++
	-- make 
	-- libxml2
	-- libcurl
	-- libconfuse


This is a re-write of the Python program "clipodder" in C++. 

Programming wise many things are different, user wise only the config format has changed. It currently uses libconfuse to parse the configuration file. 
Personally I like new configuration because everything is kept between brackets instead of one long line. The C++ version does make use of memory allocation.
It will read into memory a page, parse it, then delete it. I've tried to keep it as modular as possible to make maintanince easier/faster. 





Development:

	-- network.cpp 
	
	Used to fetch webpages and download files using libcurl. 

	-- parser.cpp 
	
	Parses the XML using libxml2 and holds relevant information.

	-- file_manager.cpp 
	
	Prepares downloads and is a "higher" level API to filesystem.cpp
	
	-- core.cpp
	
	Determines if we should download the podcast, where to, and how many. 




TODO:

	instead of "title_as_dir" use "dir_name"

	see if ctime is better than mtime

	provide a "buffer_size" argument for use with libcurl.  

	create a "clipodder-remote"
