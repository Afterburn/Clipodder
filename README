This is a re-write of the Python program "clipodder" in C++. 

Programming wise many things are different, user wise only the config format has changed. It currently uses libconfuse to parse the configuration file. 
Personally I like new configuration because everything is kept between brackets instead of one long line. The C++ version does make use of memory allocation.
It will read into memory a page, parse it, then delete it. I've tried to keep it as modular as possible to make maintanince easier/faster. 


options:

	format:
	
	Usually feeds provide a "type/extension" XML node, which clipodder will make use of. It 
	will also check against the file extension if it could not match the type from the feed.   





TODO:

	see if ctime is better than mtime

	provide a "buffer_size" argument for use with libcurl.  

	create a "clipodder-remote"
